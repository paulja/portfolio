A Swift and SwiftUI portfolio iOS, iPadOS and macOS app. This app enables you to track any hobby or task based project, where you can create a project, add progress items required to complete your project, and then track your progress at the project level as you complete your tasks.

The real purpose behind this app is to demonstrate my app building skills by using:

- Xcode
- Swift
- SwiftUI
- CoreData
- CloudKit
- Combine
- Catalyst
- Localisation
- Networking
- JSON Parsing
- Bundle and Resource management
- Documentation
- Testing
- Source Control

The project is build by using Xcode 12 and macOS 11 for iOS 14, iPadOS 14, and macOS 11.1 by using Catalyst.

## About Me
I have over 20 years of experience designing and building software for a living. My speciality is user interface design and development for mobile, specifically for the Apple ecosystem. I have been working with iOS since iOS6, initially with Objective-C and more recently with Swift and now SwiftUI. I have a proven track record of taking applications from concept to robust, scalable and secure applications, delivered and published through the AppStore. Within the last 5 years I have put over 30+ iOS and iPadOS apps successfully through the AppStore.

I work for companies large and small, as well as one-man-bands and start-ups, helping to make their ideas a reality. As an Architect I have extensive experience building backend services to support the mobile apps. I have used various languages over the years to build the services, but these days more typically in use Swift or Go (golang), with JSON messaging or REST based depending on the needs of the App features. Hosted in various ways from self hosting, PaaS, IaaS or Lambda. I have hands-on experience with various hosting platforms including iCloud, AWS, IBM, Digital Ocean and more, where security and performance is my primary focus.
