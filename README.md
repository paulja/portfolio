A Swift and SwiftUI portfolio iOS, iPadOS and macOS app. This app enables you to track any hobby or task based project, where you can create a project, add progress items required to complete your project, and then track your progress at the project level as you complete your tasks.

The real purpose behind this app is to demonstrate my app building skills by using:

- Xcode
- Swift
- SwiftUI
- CoreData
- CloudKit
- Combine
- Catalyst
- Localisation
- Networking
- JSON Parsing
- Bundle and Resource management
- Documentation
- Testing
- Source Control

The project is build by using Xcode 12 and macOS 11 for iOS 14, iPadOS 14, and macOS 11.1 by using Catalyst.

## About Me
I have 20+ years of building software for a living, from Enterprise business apps, services and portals to mobile games and lots in between. I have personal experience of getting over 30+ iPhone and iPad apps through the AppStore process, having developed the apps myself since iOS 6 onwards, initially with Objective-C and more recently with Swift and now SwiftUI.

My focus is user interface design and development for mobile, however, I have extensive experience building backend APIs for mobile services, typically written in Swift or Go (golang), with JSON messaging or REST based depending on the needs of the consumer and service. Hosted in various ways from self hosting, PaaS, IaaS or Lambda, experience with various hosting platforms including AWS, IBM, Digital Ocean and others. Focusing on security and performance, backed by numerous datastore solutions including relational databases, ElasticSearch, CouchDB, Redis and others.
